 collaborative role
between double-acting cylinder and the torsion spring as the
power element in the design of jumping robots. 

system consists of two legs with hip,
knee, and ankle joints. We installed a pneumatic cylinder and
a torsion spring on each joint which has one degree of
freedom. 


Advantages of pneumatic cylinders and torsion spring
small, light, and
has a high power-to-weight ratio, at the mean time it can store
energy easily and accelerate in a short time

The torsion
spring can not only store the energy, but also increase the
flexibility of joints. 

 We installed pneumatic cylinder in the
leg joints to imitate the muscle in the jumping movement.
Torsion springs simulate the role of tendon energy storage,
while increase joint flexibility.

When the robot contracting the legs after take-off in the
air, torsion spring can not only reduces the collision produced
by the pneumatic cylinder, but also stores the remaining
energy.

Experimental results show that exploiting the synergy
between double-acting cylinder and the torsion spring as the
power element is effective. 


Disadvantages of pneumatic cylinders
The losses of pressure and air compressibility make the pneumatics less efficient than other methods of linear motion.

Accurate control and efficiency require proportional regulators and valves, but this increases costs and complexity. 

In order to return to its position, the piston of the actuator requires the force of a return spring or fluid supplied on the other side of the piston.


Main aim of designing leg for jumping
is making the actuation to release
large instantaneous force in a short duration.
