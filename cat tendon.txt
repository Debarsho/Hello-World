Basic aim and structure: we are developing robot legs inspired by the                    
bi-articular muscle-tendon complex of cats.
For the knee and ankle joints, a four-bar linkage mechanism with one elastic linkage, in which
the knee joint is driven by an electric rotary motor and the
ankle joint is passive.

In general,from the view of the biomechanic point, the muscles and
the tendons can be replaced by the combination of linear actuators and viscoelastic elements in engineering.

Limitation of hydraulic cylinder:For
Although the hydraulic cylinder is able to generate
large force, a big energy source is required to drive it. It
results the increase in size and weight of the robot, and it
is difficult to reproduce instantaneous motions like animals.

The pneumatic artificial muscles behave like muscles in small
size, but it can produce only small output and is not suitable
for precise control. Therefore, electric rotary motors with
excellent controllability, light weight and compact size as
well as low cost, are still attractive as the actuators for the
legged robots

Most of the kinetic energy can be stored to
the elastic linkage as elastic energy during landing phase.
And the stored energy is released passively together with the
active motor actuating during the jumping process to achieve
high and efficient jumping.
