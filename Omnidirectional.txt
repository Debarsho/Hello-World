developed the robotic platform based on components and parts that are readily
available off-the shelf and are found in most typical hardware and
electronic shops. 

the controller obtains the instantaneous average of the
gyroscope reading to determine if indeed the desired motion is
attained. 


This is a radio controlled robot.
The Radio Controller is used to input commands wirelessly from
the user to the robot. We used an off-the-shelf remote-controlled
car controller and customized it according to our desired application. 

The Receiver located at the platform receives the commands
and sends them to the controller module. 

The Controller Module
converts user commands and the data from the sensors to be processed in the hopping algorithm. These enable the operation of
the hopping mechanism.
 
The Hopping Mechanism consists of
three legs that have springs which continuously compress and
decompress in a quick manner in order to lift the robot from the
ground, thus performing a hopping movement. 

The spring of each leg compresses at varying speed with respect to
the other legs to enable hopping at the desired directions. 
Thus, 4 operations namely forward , backward, left and right could be executed.

The Motor is the actuator employed to achieve the entire hopping mechanism. It rotates the
cam continuously and aids the quick release mechanism for hopping.

Limitations:
In this specific model, the shock absorbent system is not well adopted.
The springs are attached vertically, so in order to have a efficient shock absorber,
the spring has to conpress a length which is not possible keeping in mind the height of 
the robot and the length of the springs. 
This model is only suitable for short jumps.
So, in most jumping robots, 2 or 3 segment legs are implemented.
